## Generate config model

Run `generate-config` to use the script in `scripts/index.ts` and produce a `json` that will be used as a base model for the config and parsed on the app init in the `EditorProvider` service.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
